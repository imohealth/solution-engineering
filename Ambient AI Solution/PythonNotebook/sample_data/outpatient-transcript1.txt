**Transcript:**

**Dr. Smith:** Good morning, Jane. How can I help you today?

**Jane:** Good morning, Dr. Smith. I've been having a stomach ache for the past few days, and it's been getting worse.

**Dr. Smith:** I see. Let's start by getting some more details. When did the stomach ache first start?

**Jane:** It started about three days ago. It was mild at first, but now it's pretty constant and uncomfortable.

**Dr. Smith:** Okay. Can you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, cramping, or burning?

**Jane:** It's mostly a dull ache, but sometimes it feels like cramping.

**Dr. Smith:** Where exactly is the pain located? Is it in one specific area or more generalized?

**Jane:** It's mostly in the middle of my abdomen, around my belly button.

**Dr. Smith:** Have you noticed any factors that make the pain worse or better? For example, does eating, drinking, or moving around affect it?

**Jane:** Eating seems to make it worse, especially after meals. Drinking water doesn’t seem to help much either.

**Dr. Smith:** Have you had any changes in your bowel movements? Any diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?

**Jane:** No, my bowel movements have been normal. No diarrhea, constipation, or blood that I’ve noticed.

**Dr. Smith:** Any nausea or vomiting accompanying the stomach ache?

**Jane:** A little nausea, but I haven’t vomited.

**Dr. Smith:** Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu? Or maybe any new medications or changes in your diet?

**Jane:** No recent illnesses. I haven’t started any new medications, but I have been eating a lot of spicy food lately.

**Dr. Smith:** I see. Any history of similar issues in the past?

**Jane:** Not really. This is the first time I’ve had something like this.

**Dr. Smith:** Alright, Jane. Based on your symptoms, it could be related to dietary factors, especially since you mentioned eating spicy food. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I’d like to perform a physical exam and possibly some tests.

**Jane:** Sure, what do I need to do?

**Dr. Smith:** First, I’ll do a physical exam, including pressing on your abdomen to check for tenderness or other abnormalities. Then, I might order some blood tests and possibly a stool test to check for infections or other issues.

**Jane:** Okay, that sounds fine.

**Dr. Smith:** During the exam, please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort when I press on certain areas.

(Physical exam conducted)

**Dr. Smith:** Your abdomen is a bit tender around the middle, but there are no signs of severe inflammation or other abnormalities. I’ll go ahead and order some blood tests and a stool test. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and anything that seems to aggravate the pain. You can take over-the-counter antacids if needed for relief, but please avoid any medications that might irritate your stomach further, like ibuprofen.

**Jane:** Thank you, Dr. Smith. I’ll follow your advice.

**Dr. Smith:** You’re welcome. I’ll have the lab call you with the test results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up visit to discuss them. If the pain becomes severe or you experience any new symptoms, please come back or call the office immediately.

**Jane:** I will. Thanks again.

**Dr. Smith:** Take care, Jane. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
