**Transcript:**

**Dr. Carter:** Good afternoon, Michael. How can I help you today?

**Michael:** Good afternoon, Dr. Carter. I’ve been feeling a bit off lately, and my home blood pressure monitor shows that my blood pressure has been consistently high.

**Dr. Carter:** I see. Let’s start by discussing your symptoms and getting some more details. How high have your blood pressure readings been?

**Michael:** They’ve been around 150/95 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg over the past week.

**Dr. Carter:** Okay. Have you been experiencing any symptoms along with the high blood pressure, such as headaches, dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath?

**Michael:** I’ve had some headaches, especially in the mornings, and I feel a bit dizzy at times.

**Dr. Carter:** Any changes in your vision, like blurriness?

**Michael:** No, my vision seems fine.

**Dr. Carter:** Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?

**Michael:** No swelling that I’ve noticed.

**Dr. Carter:** Any recent changes in your diet, physical activity, stress levels, or medications?

**Michael:** I haven’t changed my diet much, but I’ve been under a lot of stress at work lately. I haven’t started any new medications.

**Dr. Carter:** Have you had any family history of high blood pressure or other heart-related conditions?

**Michael:** Yes, my father had high blood pressure, and he had a heart attack in his early 60s.

**Dr. Carter:** Alright, Michael. Based on your symptoms and family history, it’s important that we address your high blood pressure. I’ll need to take your blood pressure here in the clinic and perform a physical exam. Afterward, we can discuss a plan to manage it.

**Michael:** Sure, let’s do that.

(Blood pressure measurement taken: 158/98 mmHg)

**Dr. Carter:** Your blood pressure is indeed high. Let’s proceed with a physical exam.

(Physical exam conducted)

**Dr. Carter:** Your physical exam doesn’t show any immediate signs of complications, but we need to get this under control. I’ll order some blood tests to check for underlying conditions like kidney function and cholesterol levels. In the meantime, I recommend some lifestyle changes: reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, managing stress, and possibly limiting alcohol consumption.

**Michael:** What about medication?

**Dr. Carter:** We’ll start with lifestyle changes and re-evaluate in a few weeks. If your blood pressure doesn’t improve, we may need to consider medication. For now, I’ll give you some information on diet and exercise that can help.

**Michael:** That sounds good. I’ll try to make those changes.

**Dr. Carter:** Great. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to check your blood pressure and review the test results. If you experience any severe symptoms like chest pain, severe headache, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention immediately.

**Michael:** I will. Thank you, Dr. Carter.

**Dr. Carter:** You’re welcome, Michael. Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
