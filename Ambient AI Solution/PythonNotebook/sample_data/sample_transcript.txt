The patient rates the pain as 8 out of 10 in severity. He also notes associated symptoms including nausea, diaphoresis, and difficulty breathing.

Past medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago, type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and hyperlipidemia. He has no known drug allergies. Current medications include metformin 1000 milligrams twice daily, lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily, and atorvastatin 40 milligrams at bedtime. The patient is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history, quit 2 years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father who had a heart attack at age 62.

On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs show blood pressure 160 over 95, heart rate 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and oxygen saturation 94 percent on room air. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Extremities show no edema.

EKG demonstrates ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V4, consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Initial cardiac biomarkers show troponin I elevated at 2.5 nanograms per milliliter, which is significantly above the normal range. Complete blood count reveals hemoglobin 14.2, white blood cell count 11.5, platelets 245,000. Basic metabolic panel shows sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 156. Lipid panel from 3 months ago showed total cholesterol 245, LDL 165, HDL 38, triglycerides 210.

Assessment: This is a 58-year-old male with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, anterior wall, with ongoing chest pain. Additional diagnoses include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

Plan: Immediate cardiac catheterization with plan for percutaneous coronary intervention. Aspirin 325 milligrams chewed immediately, followed by clopidogrel 600 milligram loading dose. Start heparin infusion at 80 units per kilogram bolus followed by 18 units per kilogram per hour. Nitroglycerin sublingual for chest pain relief. Morphine 2 to 4 milligrams IV as needed for pain not relieved by nitroglycerin. Admit to coronary care unit. Cardiology consultation for catheterization and possible stent placement. Continue home medications including metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Add metoprolol 25 milligrams twice daily once hemodynamically stable. Serial cardiac biomarkers every 6 hours. Continuous cardiac monitoring. Consider adding ACE inhibitor optimization post-procedure. Patient education regarding lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and medication compliance. Smoking cessation counseling reinforced. Follow-up with cardiology within one week post-discharge.
