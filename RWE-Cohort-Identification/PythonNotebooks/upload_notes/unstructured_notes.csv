Requesting physician: [NAME_1]


Reason for consult: dyspnea, cough


Chief complaint: Shortness of breath, cough


History of present illness: 


 This is a [AGE_1]-year-old white female patient who was originally admitted to the 

hospital on [DATE_2] when she came in for evaluation of hematuria, severe 

right-sided flank pain, nausea and vomiting.  Patient had a diagnosis of kidney 

stones in the past.  Her urinalysis showed large number of white blood cells, 

greater than 182, and red blood cells, with moderate leukocyte esterase, 4+ 

glucose, 2+ protein negative for nitrites.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 

right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter and probable calculus in the distal 

right ureter.  On [DATE_3] patient had a cystoscopy with placement of a 

double-J catheter on [DATE_3] for an obstructing 9 mm distal ureteral stone.  

Patient's past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus, GERD, and 

depression.  She is a nonsmoker and nondrinker.  Patient had episode of chest 

pain on [DATE_4] and cardiology was consulted.  The chest pain was associated 

with shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm 

with no acute ST or T-wave changes, she did have a mildly elevated troponin 

levels of 0.036, 0.025, and 0.037.  Her proBNP level was elevated at 4830.  

Chest x-ray showed perihilar and right suprahilar opacity that could represent 

pneumonia along with increased interstitial density.  COVID PCR was negative.  

Patient was given IV Lasix, her d-dimer was 27.05.  CTA chest showed no acute 

pulmonary embolism, and scattered reticular nodular opacities with somewhat 

tree-in-bud appearance, nonspecific findings.  Bilateral right greater than left

pleural effusions.  Patient did have an episode of low-grade fever early this 

morning with a temp of 100.1F.  She states she has been coughing, however the 

cough is not new, she's been coughing for the past 6 months, no phlegm 

production, no hemoptysis, she does have history of GERD.  She is a nonsmoker.  

There is no phlegm production.  She is on room air, with a pulse ox of 92-93%, 

she denies any exertional dyspnea.  She has been on IV Rocephin since 

[DATE_3].  Urine culture showed Candida glabrata.  Today's labs have been 

reviewed showing white blood cell count of 9.1, hemoglobin of 11.9, sodium is 

136, potassium is 4.5, chloride is 107, BUN is 22, creatinine of 0.9.  Echocard

iogram has been reviewed showing preserved LV function with EF of 55-60%, normal

diastolic filling pattern, mild to moderate tricuspid regurg, and mild to 

moderate pulmonary hypertension with right-sided pressure of 46.7 mmHg.

hospital admissions related to respiratory failure, recently was admitted to Woodlake Nursing Home.  
The patient was using her noninvasive ventilator as suggested and her condition started to deteriorat
e and details were discussed with family regarding her poor prognosis, worsening respiratory failure 
problem, and options of hospice care were discussed with family and family did decide to put her on h
ospice care.  The patient was still full code and with her deteriorating condition, she was sent to h
ospital.  As I understand, family had not made a decision about DNR at nursing home, sent her to hosp
ital with worsening condition with altered mental status and worsening respiratory failure problem.  
After the patient arrived to the emergency room, she was placed on BiPAP and ER physician, Dr. [NAME_1]
on communicated with the patient's son as well as the patient's husband and granddaughter, and he dis
cussed code status and when he called, informed me that family has decided no intubation, no CPR, no 
defibrillation and DNR order was written in the chart and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Plan:  We will go ahead and admit the patient to hospital for further evaluation and management of th
is problem.  The patient was recently admitted to the hospital.  In the hospital, I had a detailed di
scussion with the patient's granddaughter this morning regarding very poor prognosis.  The patient ha
s had multiple prior hospital admissions and her condition now has deteriorated to the extent that he
r life span is very limited in my opinion.  The patient's granddaughter understands that.  She has co
mmunicated details with the patient's son who is in Virginia and he should be arriving here in town e
ither today or tomorrow to visit her.  We did discuss about the options of hospice care to be done in
 the hospital, but that will allow only limited number of days.  After that, we will have to decide d
isposition whether she will be going back to nursing home with hospice or home with hospice and all t
hese details, granddaughter will communicate with the patient's son and will have some communication 
again tomorrow regarding this.  We will continue empiric antibiotic, IV steroid, IV fluid.  Diabetes 
will be managed with sliding scale. Rhumatoid Artheritis will be managed with methotrexate 25 MG/ML 
Auto-Injector.  Overall prognosis is poor and the patient is likely to expire in the near future.

History of Present Illness


This patient was sent here for a ventral hernia repair which he underwent on 

[DATE_2].  Patient under the care of general surgery team.  Patient had done

really well after surgery initially she was actually planning to start trialing 

liquids yesterday however she had some worsening in her overall status 

concerning for sepsis.  She was hypotensive and tachycardic up to the 160s.  Her

work-up showed A. fib with RVR requiring a Cardizem drip.  Was evaluated by Dr. 

[NAME_1] who was concerned about her status recommending ICU transfer.  Infectious

Disease and pulmonary were consulted.  Patient started on broad-spectrum 

antibiotics.  Pulmonary following.





[DATE_3]


Patient evaluated in the ICU today.  Her condition has significantly improved 

since last night.  She is awake alert and oriented able to answer questions says

pain is under control.  Blood pressure holding steady.  Remains on Cardizem 

drip.  Continue antibiotics today.  Suspect she can transfer out of ICU if beds 

are needed.  Requesting to drink if she can, will defer this decision to 

surgery.

- Plan


Plan:: 





Patient is an [AGE_1]-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, and sleep

apnea noncompliant with CPAP, who was brought to the ER from her assisted living

facility due to AMS.  In the ER, she was found to have a severe CO2 retention.





AMS


Most likely due to CO2 retention/respiratory acidosis, delirium


CT of head - no acute change


Closely monitor





Acute on chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure


Respiratory acidosis


Chronic CO2 retention


She is normally on 2L at home


decreased her home tramadol to 25mg QID from 50mg QID


ABG pH 7.24, PCO2 110.8, PO2 60.0, oxygen saturation 85.3.  Repeat ABG after use

of BiPAP pH 7.30, PCO2 95.3, PO2 72.0, oxygen saturation 93.3


Patient has a sleep apnea but not compliant with CPAP in the setting of end 

stage of COPD. Furthermore, she possibly has obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 


ABG today pH 7.48, PCO2 55.6, PO2 64.0, oxygen saturation 94.5


Pulse ox


She is now on 2 L. Continue oxygen therapy, BiPAP as needed to keep her PCO2 

less than 50 and SPO2 greater than 80%





COPD exacerbation


CXR - no acute change


End-stage renal of lung disease


Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily


Solu-Medrol 40 mg every 8 hours


Inhalers





Sleep apnea





Continue BiPAP


Will educate her to be compliant with CPAP when she is discharged





DM type 2


Diabetic diet


glipizide 2.5mg daily


Insulin sliding scale


Adjust insulin based on sugar levels.





HTN


Is not well controlled


Added amlodipine 2.5 mg daily


Hydralazine as needed





Obesity


BMI 38.6


Lifestyle modification


Follow with PCP





Thrombocytopenia


124 on admission


No evidence of bleeding


Repeat CBC in morning





DVT prophylaxis: Eliquis 5 mg twice daily (do not know why patient is on 

Eliquis)





CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI


Both ER physician Dr. [NAME_1] and I discussed that with her son who would like 

to do DNR/DNI.  Her daughter is in agreement with the decision.





Disposition: 1 or 2 more days








[DATE_4]





The patient is an [AGE_1]-year-old lady who will be retained in hospitalization.  For

the patient's COPD she will be continued on the doxycycline and Solu-Medrol.  

The patient also has been noted to be requiring less oxygen and her CO2 has 

fallen although it still elevated.  The patient does have CO2 retention.  The 

patient will also have oxygen titrated to keep her saturations around 90 to 92%.

 She is also on BiPAP and CPAP device as needed.  The patient will have her 

antihypertensive medications adjusted as necessary.  The patient will have 

repeat laboratory studies for the morning.  She also be continued on her 

diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale.  The patient will also be appropriate 

for discharge in 1 to 2 days.





[DATE_5]





The patient is an [AGE_1]-year-old lady who will remain in hospitalization currently 

awaiting placement.  Oxygen support will be continued for the patient to 

maintain her saturations around 92%.  I have also ordered testing for C. 

difficile colitis.  The patient is currently on doxycycline and this will be 

continued for her.  The patient does not need DVT prophylaxis as she is 

currently on apixaban.  Patient will continue on her diabetic diet as tolerated.

 She will have insulin as needed.  The patient will also have repeat laboratory 

studies ordered.





[DATE_6]





The patient is an [AGE_1]-year-old lady who is much more awake and alert.  She is 

currently pending placement.  The patient's oxygen support will continue to keep

her saturations around 92%.  The patient's bicarb had almost improved to normal.

 I suspect that the patient's hypercapnic state is chronic in nature and likely 

leading to her increased falling.  Regardless the patient will need to have 

skilled nursing facility placement in order to safely transition to home.  The 

patient's antibiotics were continued.  She has been treated for exacerbation of 

her COPD.  The patient is currently on apixaban likely secondary to atrial 

fibrillation.  She is diabetic and will have diabetic diet as tolerated.  She is

also have insulin sliding scale.  Repeat laboratory studies have been ordered."

option.
